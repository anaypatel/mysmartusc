Instructions for running MySmartUSC application
  1) Download .zip file into Android Studio and run app with emulator
  Note: testing was performed with Nexus 5 emulator running Marshmallow OS

Instructions for using application
  1) The first step to using the app is to sign in with your Gmail credentials. This will take you to the homepage.
  2) On the homepage, the three buttons take you to the Notifications page, the Settings page, or the Account page.
  3) On the notifications page, you can select any of the three buttons to see a list of the latest received emails that were      given a certain designation (i.e., they were either starred and saved, marked as urgent, or marked as spam) by the app.
  4) On the settings page, you can enter a set of keywords (separated by commas if you want to enter more than one) in each        text field. These keywords will allow the app to filter emails into the three groups listed above. The three buttons on 
     the bottom allow you to assign the keywords to only apply to emails' sender addresses, subject lines, or the body of the 
     email itself. For instance, if you want to be instantly notified if your professor sends you an email saying your last 
     test has been graded, you can enter "test", "grades," in the "Urgent" text field, then press the "Save Body" button at 
     the bottom. Then, you can enter your professor's email address in the same text field and press the "Save Sender" button.
  5) On the account page (which also shows up when you log into the app), you can either sign out of the app or go to the 
     homepage.
